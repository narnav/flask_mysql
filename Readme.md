Sure, here is a simple README.md file that you can use for your git repository:


# Flask-MySQL Example

This is a simple Flask application that connects to a MySQL database and allows you to add, get, and list cars.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:

```
python app.py


2. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/

3. You can add a new car by sending a POST request to http://localhost:5000/cars with the model and color of the car in the request body. For example, the following request would add a new car with the model `Tesla Model S` and the color `Black`:


POST /cars HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "model": "Tesla Model S",
    "color": "Black"
}


4. You can get all cars by sending a GET request to http://localhost:5000/cars.
